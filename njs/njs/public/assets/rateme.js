This workshop sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours â€“ sometimes even minutes â€“ no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. The workshop materials are derived from the best selling book Continuous Delivery and creating in collaboration with the authors and other of my ThoughtWorks colleagues.\\nPart 1: Deployment Pipelines\\nIn this workshop I move from release back through testing to development practices, analyzing at each stage how to improve collaboration and increase feedback so as to make the delivery process as fast and efficient as possible. At the heart of the workshop is a pattern called the deployment pipeline, which involves the creation of a living system that models your organizationâ€™s value stream for delivering software. I spend the first half of the workshop introducing this pattern, and discussing how to incrementally automate the build, test and deployment process, culminating in continuous deployment.\\nPart 2: Agile Infrastructure\\nIn the second half of the workshop, I introduce agile infrastructure, including the use of Puppet to automate the management of testing and production environments. We discuss automating data management, including migrations. Development practices that enable incremental development and delivery will be covered at length, including a discussion of why branching is inimical to continuous delivery, and how practices such as branch by abstraction and componentization provide superior alternatives that enable large and distributed teams to deliver incrementally.\\n\",\n        \"url\": \"http://oredev.org/2014/sessions/continuous-delivery-workshop\",\n        \"space_name\": \"Roomba\",\n        \"venue\": \"vfzb\",\n        \"start_time\": \"2014-11-04 08:30:00\",\n        \"end_time\": \"2014-11-04 17:00:00\",\n        \"speakers\": [\n          {\n            \"crowdsource_ref\": \"2014/AC1CE075351BC0A7C1257CAC003751A9\",\n            \"name\": \"Neal Ford\",\n            \"role\": \"ThoughtWorks, Inc\",\n            \"bio\": \"Neal Ford is Director, Software Architect, and Meme Wrangler at ThoughtWorks, a global IT consultancy with an exclusive focus on end-to-end software development and delivery.

Most recently, he is the leading advocate of Programmer Anarchy, a postÂ­-Agile process that is proving extremely effective and reactive to client needs, and also advocates MicroÂ­Service Architectures, the creations of systems with hundreds of tiny, looselyÂ­ coupled services. A veteran of the IBMÂ­Microsoft wars, Fred did early work in computer networking, LAN\'s, GUI\'s and objects for IBM. As an independent consultant from 1991Â­2003, he counted HP, Morgan-Â­Stanley, American Express, IBM, and USAA among his clients. He gave the first Agile/XP experience report at OOPSLA in 1999 about an embedded system done in Java, and has mentored many clients in use of objects in Java under an XP process. He has shared the stage at JavaOne with Martin Fowler, acting as his foil, and assisted in XP Immersion sessions with Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Robert Martin. Fred spent a year as a visiting lecturer at N.C. State University teaching Java programming to over 800 undergraduates, with a generous dose of object design, patterns, and XP practices thrown in. Fred joined ThoughtWorks in 2003, delivering yet more projects using agile processes. He has worked with clients in four countries since then, including a ten-Â­month assignment in India (where he founded ThoughtWorks University), four months of projects in China, and a post in the London office. In 2007, he joined the London Internet advertising firm, Forward, bringing Agile practices to all aspects of the business, leaving to pursue industry change at the end of 2011. He next was the Chief Architect at MailOnline, the online version of the Daily Mail and the worldâ€™s most popular online newspaper. There he completely restructured the IT team along the lines of Anarchy, which has now delivered a completely re-Â­engineered rendering of the MailOnline. He currently is a co-Â­founder of Outpace Systems in the US, a firm building solutions for large businesses that exploits MicroServices and a Fractal development process derived from the concepts of Programmer Anarchy. He believes in objects, Lean processes, fun in programming, and the client\'s successes. He holds a bachelors degree from N. C.

Everyday objects are already becoming smarter and in 10 years time, every piece of clothing you own, every piece of jewelry, and every thing you carry with you will be measuring, weighing and calculating. In 10 years, the worldâ€”your worldâ€”will be full of sensors. Those sensors will necessarily need computing power, and computing will almost inevitably diffuse out into our environment along with those sensors. We\'ve been talking about smart dustâ€”general purpose computing, sensors, and wireless networking, all bundled up in millimeter-scale motes drifting in the air currents, flecks of computing power, settling on your skin, ingested, monitoring you inside and outâ€”since the late 90\'s. Technology is finally catching upâ€”the major stumbling block is powering the systemsâ€”passive power generation techniques, like vibration harvesters, have already been scaled down quite nicely, and their meager energy output is well-suited to the equally tiny energy requirements of the new smart dust. But the ubiquity of smart dustâ€”the instant availability of computing power and the blanket sensor coverageâ€”means that this technological change will drive social change. The diffusion of computing into the environment will mean not just that computing power is always available, but that this computing power will drive ubiquitous monitoring and surveillance. The only real question is who will have access to the sensors, computing power, and to the data it generates. Whether the architectures for the smart dust networks will be peer-to-peer and make that computing power and sensing available to individuals, or whether the network architectures will centralise command-and-control into a few hands. In the first case the sociological changes that will drive are enormous, in the past we\'ve seen that quantifying things, informing us, quantifying the world, allows us to make better decisions. Data leads to data led decisions. In the later caseâ€”whether those hands are governmental or corporateâ€”we could end up in the middle of a smart dust war, where competing networks battle for groundâ€”in the air around you, even on your skin. We stand at the edge of another paradigm shift in computing, which like the smart phone, and the desktop computer before that, will drive social change.

Itâ€™s a fully dynamic language, yet rather than the â€œno talking about typesâ€ approach that many dynamic languages have adopted, Julia has an expressive type system, complete with parametric and dependent types. This is no accident â€“ talking about types is unavoidable in technical computing. But types arenâ€™t just used to describing the structure and layout of data in Julia â€“ they are also essential for expressing behavior. Programs are organized around multiple dispatch â€“ generic functions can be defined piecewise for various combinations of argument types. This allows the polymorphic behaviors rampant in mathematical code â€“ arithmetic operators, numeric promotions, array indexing â€“ to be expressed clearly, extensibly, and in a way that the compiler can reason about. Traditionally, this kind of flexibility and abstraction have come at the cost of performance. But by a combination of dynamic data-flow type inference (not Hindley-Milner!), and just-in-time code generation with aggressive specialization on runtime types, Juliaâ€™s compiler manages to generate efficient, low-level code despite all the abstraction.

But SQL\\ndatabases encounter problems on the web:\\n* SQL databases have a rigid information model, and typically a rigid\\n deployment model. This rigidity creates impedance mismatches both with\\n development languages and with emerging cloud strategies.\\n* SQL databases are update-in-place, and forget the history of your data.\\n* SQL databases struggle with the extremely high write and/or data volumes \\n that characterize the largest four percent of databases.\\nMuch of the effort of the NoSQL movement has gone to solve the third\\nproblem, the problem of the four percent, under the mantra &quot;web scale&quot;.\\nDatomic solves the first two problems -- with a flexible information model\\nand a deployment model suited to the dynamic web, and to the cloud.\\nDatomic is for the ninety-six percent.\\n## What We Will Cover\\nDatomic\'s information model is based on a universal relation, and an\\nentity abstraction over that relation. The universal relation\\neliminates the join keys and join tables imposed by SQL\'s plethora of\\n*specific* relations, making queries easier to write, read, and\\nunderstand. Entities expose the universal relation as associative\\ncollections, which correspond directly to the navigable, associative\\nstyle of OO, eliminating the impedance mismatch and the need for\\nlibraries such as ActiveRecord and Hibernate.\\nDatomic stores information immutably, and remembers the past. This has \\ntwo key benefits:\\n* You can query as-of now, or as-of other points in time, or across\\n a range of time.\\n* The database is an immutable, distributed, cache-friendly value that\\n can be queried *locally* from any peer process. Queries run &quot;over\\n here&quot;, in your application process space, not &quot;over there&quot; in a\\n special database process. As a result, query scales horizontally.\\nDatomic\'s deployment model is designed for a virtualized world. All\\ncomponents of the system are designed from the ground up to be\\nephemeral. More importantly, Datomic treats storage as a separate\\nservice. You can store your data on the local filesystem during\\ndevelopment, and upgrade to using a SQL database for storage for\\nproduction. When you are ready for the cloud, you can store your data\\nin a distributed storage such as Amazon\'s DynamoDB, CouchBase, or\\nRiak.\\nDatomic\'s flexibility comes with the expressive power you know and\\nlove in SQL databases. Where the four percent need &quot;web scale&quot;, and\\nthe complex programming model imposed by eventual consistency, most\\nprograms would be better off with the traditional values: ACID\\ntransactions and powerful queries. Datomic gives you these in spades:\\ntransactions always run at the highest isolation level (serialized),\\nand the Datalog query language has greater expressive power than the\\nrelational algebra at the foundation of SQL.\\nIf you are among the ninety-six percent, and manage transactional data\\nof record on the web, Datomic may be a good fit for you.\\n## Resources\\n* 2013 [NFJS slides](https://github.com/stuarthalloway/presentations/blob/master/NFJS_Nov_2013/datomic_for_the_96_percent/DatomicForThe96Percent.pdf?raw=true)\",\n        \"url\": \"http://oredev.org/2014/sessions/datomic-for-the-96-percent\",\n        \"space_name\": \"T-800\",\n        \"venue\": \"vfzb\",\n        \"start_time\": \"2014-11-06 15:40:00\",\n        \"end_time\": \"2014-11-06 16:20:00\",\n        \"speakers\": [\n          {\n            \"crowdsource_ref\": \"2014/97D958DDB1B16882C1257C98004B84E1\",\n            \"name\": \"Ryan Neufeld\",\n            \"role\": \"Independent\",\n            \"bio\": \"Ryan is a polyglot software developer and budding architect.

This talk will demonstrate how to get started with Cloud Foundry by live-coding an application (with a front-end, a back-end, and even a middle-bit) and then live-deploying it to the web.\",\n        \"url\": \"http://oredev.org/2014/sessions/do-more-of-what-you-love-less-of-what-you-dont-love-with-cloud-foundry\",\n        \"space_name\": \"T-800\",\n        \"venue\": \"vfzb\",\n        \"start_time\": \"2014-11-06 16:40:00\",\n        \"end_time\": \"2014-11-06 17:20:00\",\n        \"speakers\": [\n          {\n            \"crowdsource_ref\": \"2014/A7FD0BB503354A4EC1257CCA003B72AF\",\n            \"name\": \"Holly Cummins\",\n            \"role\": \"IBM\",\n            \"bio\": \"Holly Cummins is a senior software engineer developing enterprise middleware with the IBM WebSphere, and a committer on the Apache Aries project.

It is truly our most intimate device. We take it everywhere we go, including to bed. We share all the moments of our lives with it, sometimes on camera. It connects us constantly to the people we love the most. The keyboard separates us from the computer, but touch brings us closer to our mobile device(s). From how we spend our time (many of the most popular applications are games) to the natural extension of a custom ringtone to a dedicated space on the device for our partner, love is a design consideration.\\nWe Have Changed\\nFrom personal tracking devices to selling sheep via instagram, these devices have changed the way we live. Whilst we are more in control of, and have more information than ever before, increasingly people feel overwhelmed, suffer from decision fatigue, and seek out solutions like the â€œdisconnected vacationâ€. A decade ago, such a thing was just â€œvacationâ€. \\nWe Are Not Really Here\\nWhilst we carry out devices with us constantly, our attention is split between them and the world around us. They are the accompaniment to our commute, whilst we wait in line, whilst we watch TV. Our attention is intermittent, and incomplete. Multitasking has a cognitive overhead comparable to being intoxicated (see the effects of texting whilst driving). Ideas like â€œphone stackingâ€ aim to address this lack of presence in our human interactions, but when we design we must design for the distracted user.

No, really!\",\n        \"abstract\": \"Just like a company, a codebase comprises many elemental components with countless interdependencies. At the elemental level, this is far too complex for human comprehension, and developers are after all human. If they cannot comprehend a codebase, they cannot develop it efficiently. To understand and evolve all the detail, it is necessary to organize the functions, files, classes, etc. into well-structured, higher-level containers, which can be understood without understanding all the detail, and whoâ€™s relationships with other containers is clearly defined. This is the basic principle of abstraction, divide-and-conquer, modularity.\\nComprehension is just the beginning of what is at stake here. A well-structured containment model serves as a blue-print or roadmap for developers; allows for phased testing and release of subsystems; enables the division of labor across organizations, teams, and individual developers; shelters components from changes to the internals of other components; allows subsystems or layers to completely replaced; helps new developers become productive quickly; etc. etc. etc. In short we are talking about a spectrum from chaotic, ad-hoc development, through to true agile software engineering. \\nThe talk will show why poor structure has such a negative effect on the various aspects of production listed above, and quantify the complexity behind this effect.\\nJust as a company with 6 employees requires a drastically simpler org chart and inter-departmental controls than a company of 600 employees, structure is less critical in the early stages of a software development. At a certain size however, the explosive increase in complexity caused by the exponential growth of dependencies makes it essential to continued development velocity. Almost invariably this point is overshot and projects find themselves in very deep complexity debt before the need is realized. \\nThe talk then shows how to organize the files in the codebase into a cogent containment model (or architecture) with minimal impact on the working code. There are 3 angles of attack. First, if there are any large groups of cyclically dependent classes, these should be disentangled, and the process for doing this is explained. Second, existing physical arrangements of source files into e.g. packages, folders, namespaces, etc. can serve as a start point. Thirdly, it is possible to discover cohesive groups of classes and organize them recursively into a containment hierarchy. \\nThe architectural discovery cannot be achieved without the help of â€œcode-firstâ€ modeling tools such as Structure101, Lattix, and SonarGraph. Short examples using Structure101 will be shown so as to make the principles more concrete. All the main tool options in this space will be briefly mentioned. \\nThe clearly articulated connection between quantifiable complexity and the efficiency of development activities, and specific practical steps to reduce complexity and drive up development agility, is new, and offers potentially huge savings to our industry. \\n\",\n        \"url\": \"http://oredev.org/2014/sessions/you-really-should-organise-that-codebase-no-really\",\n        \"space_name\": \"KITT\",\n        \"venue\": \"vfzb\",\n        \"start_time\": \"2014-11-07 10:20:00\",\n        \"end_time\": \"2014-11-07 11:00:00\",\n        \"speakers\": [\n          {\n            \"crowdsource_ref\": \"2014/195CE726D8B43A09C1257CAC006CEFCD\",\n            \"name\": \"Chris Chedgey\",\n            \"role\": \"Structure101\",\n            \"bio\": \"Chris cut his development teeth on monster military and aerospace projects in Europe and Canada (including 5 years on the International Space Station program).

A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then and now what most people think of when talking about object orientation, is in the words of the father of MVC class-orientation. The distinction between object orientation and class orientation being that objects as Kay envisioned them, a are dynamic runtime entities, to the extent that they from a type theoretic perspective might change their type during execution. Class orientation is a limited view of the system and makes it hard to impossible to reason about runtime behavior by looking at the code. \\nA system is only as good as the end users value it and a common obstacle in software development is the communication gap between end users and developers. End users have a mental model of the system and as human beings we are better at using tools if the underlying model of the world resembles our own. But most contemporary architectural schools based in the class oriented world violate the users mental model, e.g. an operation that the user sees as a whole might be distributed across several classes, where each class describes an entity that the user knows but also operations that can be performed on that entity, which to the user might very well be external to the entity.\\n \\nEvolution has equipped us with the ability to learn by example and we are programmed to base our learnings on previous learnings. That is why it is not difficult to learn English as a mother tongue but inherently so if your mother tongue is French and the real important fact is that it doesn\'t really matter how long you\'ve lived in England, if your mother tongue is French most people will be able to tell until the day you die. Learning a computer system is the same. If the model used in the system fits your view of the domain you will be better at using the system and for complex systems that advantage does not go away over time. This all comes back to the communication gap. If we are capable of capturing the mental model of the end users we reduce the communication gap and might even be able to talk more successfully to end users about architecture if not code artifacts.\\nWhen coaching Olympic athletes or business professionals you learn among other things how to illicit the underlying motivations, hopes and dreams of the individual and by that help the individual to figure out their own needs and through the process commit to a plan of actions to reach the dream.When you help them formulate the dream, you will help them formulate goals on the way to the dream. If the dream is participation at the Olympics you might have a goal of qualifying for the world championship the preceding season and to learn a specific technical detail prior to participation in the worlds . This process is repeated until you have set first goals to accomplish this year, this month and in the end you have a (set) of goals for today. In this way you as a coach can work together with the athlete to find the path of least resistance that leads to the dream. This process has been researched extensively. The sole factor that sets all high achievers a part, is dedication to refine goals and subgoals to the extent that while practicing, new goals for the next drill might be based the execution of the current drill.This is also referred to as dedicated practice and has been shown to be the important factor in a variety of fields such as sports, music, chess and business. \\nIf we view the development of a complete system as reaching the dream we could use the same approach. We start by formulating a dream for our software. It should be formulated in functional terms. Several goals and dreams might be fulfilled with the same piece of software. E.g. a word processor might be used to write a book or love letter but we start with one, just like the athlete we start with the one we believe has the highest value. We divide the dream into goals which we might call milestones or major releases and each of these into minor releases and we continue till we reach sprints and tasks. However doing this top down and asking the right questions, we capture the user mental model in the process and if we ask smart questions we not only capture the requirements and the mental model, we also find the path of least resistance to the most elegant solution. We will for each goal end up with a distinct system (or object in the Alan kay model) and each of these systems will be a distinct artifact in code as well as in documentation and be part of the user mental model. \\nThe resulting structure of the documentation when following this approach is a network of interconnected goals, and if we view each goal as a distinct system then said network is very much like Alan Kay\'s view of an object oriented system.\\nIn the spirit of Lean, we should strive to only produce what we need and since each of these systems makes for a pretotyping candidate it would be a perfectly valid approach to treat the entire development life cycle as incrementally building new pretotypes.\\nWhat proponents such as the farther of MVC, Trygve Reenskauge or one of the founders of the software patterns discipline James &quot;Cope&quot; Coplien calls full OO are extremely good at expressing this kind of systems. DDD would lead us to divide the system based on the entities of the end user mental model and attach the parts of the system operation that are related to each entity to the same class. That destroys the ability to reason about the code unless you are able to construct the call graph mentally. If parts of the system are polymorphic, trying to do so will be futile. Full OO enables us to build complex systems where each complete system operation is located in the same code entity while still dividing the domain into the entities of the real world as they are represented in the end user mental model. This results in the ability to reason about runtime behavior of a specific and complete system operation and since the code entity will be directly related to a specific part of the requirements, it is possible to review these in union and possible to review the correctness together with the end users.\\nThe talk will go through the steps in the process of creating great systems and will describe the design and requirements process along with giving examples of how to structure and implement the system based on the DCI paradigm. The concept of pretotyping will also be touched upon but the talk is not as such a talk on pretotyping.\\nThe delegates can expect to be able to comfortably use the design approach when the talk is over and to have a sufficient understanding of the DCI to be able to try it out themselves. \\n\",\n        \"url\": \"http://oredev.org/2014/sessions/creating-great-systems-with-the-help-of-olympic-athletes-agile-and-pretotypes\",\n        \"space_name\": \"Wall-E\",\n        \"venue\": \"vfzb\",\n        \"start_time\": \"2014-11-07 11:20:00\",\n        \"end_time\": \"2014-11-07 12:00:00\",\n        \"speakers\": [\n          {\n            \"crowdsource_ref\": \"2014/F5F4253B7BD91933C1257CA5003536E0\",\n            \"name\": \"Rune Funch SÃ¸ltoft\",\n            \"role\": \"Asseco Danmark\",\n            \"bio\": \"I was born in 1975 an raised without computers.

A veteran of the IBMÂ­Microsoft wars, Fred did early work in computer networking, LAN\'s, GUI\'s and objects for IBM. As an independent consultant from 1991Â­2003, he counted HP, Morgan-Â­Stanley, American Express, IBM, and USAA among his clients. He gave the first Agile/XP experience report at OOPSLA in 1999 about an embedded system done in Java, and has mentored many clients in use of objects in Java under an XP process. He has shared the stage at JavaOne with Martin Fowler, acting as his foil, and assisted in XP Immersion sessions with Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Robert Martin. Fred spent a year as a visiting lecturer at N.C. State University teaching Java programming to over 800 undergraduates, with a generous dose of object design, patterns, and XP practices thrown in. Fred joined ThoughtWorks in 2003, delivering yet more projects using agile processes. He has worked with clients in four countries since then, including a ten-Â­month assignment in India (where he founded ThoughtWorks University), four months of projects in China, and a post in the London office. In 2007, he joined the London Internet advertising firm, Forward, bringing Agile practices to all aspects of the business, leaving to pursue industry change at the end of 2011. He next was the Chief Architect at MailOnline, the online version of the Daily Mail and the worldâ€™s most popular online newspaper. There he completely restructured the IT team along the lines of Anarchy, which has now delivered a completely re-Â­engineered rendering of the MailOnline. He currently is a co-Â­founder of Outpace Systems in the US, a firm building solutions for large businesses that exploits MicroServices and a Fractal development process derived from the concepts of Programmer Anarchy.

===================
**API**   
   The api part is hosted on Heroku with a free sandbox database from mongolabs.  
     
**Client**  
    The client is built in Ember.js.  
    To start it up you need to clone the repo:  
    cd client && npm install  
    bower install  
    ember serve
    
    The client build tool is broccolli so to get a better understanding of how to use is take a look at https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli
